# PRINCE2 Foundation summary #

The essential knowledge for the PRINCE2 foundation exam. All bullet points are very brief, for details you better refer to the excellent [PRINCE2 foundation training manual by Management Plaza](http://www.mgmtplaza.com/elearn/dirBooks/P2FPM42.pdf).


## Core aspects ##

### Projects in general ###
- projects introduce change, are unique and bring a certain amount of uncertainty
- defined start and end (temporary), cross-functional (involves people from different departments)
- PRINCE2 definition: **project** is a temporary organization created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to an agreed Business Case 
- **program**: set of related projects

### PRINCE2 core principles ###
framework for good project practice for those involved in a project:

1. continued business justification (throughout the project lifetime)
2. learn from experience
3. defined roles and responsibilities (who does what, what to expect from others, various stakeholders: business sponsors, users, suppliers)
4. manage by stages (separated by decision points, manageable chunks)
5. manage by exception (when things go outside the agreed tolerances)
6. focus on products (everyone has the same idea of the product)
7. tailor to suit the project environment (different paperwork depending on size, environment, complexity, ...)

### PRINCE2 structure / core elements ###
- principles
- themes (what items must be addressed, e.g. Business Case, Organization, Quality, Change)
- processes (what activities and by whom)
- tailoring

### six variables / tolerances / performance targets / goals ###
- timescales (the "when")
- costs (budget)
- quality (usable product)
- scope (defined scope, stakeholders involved, what is mandatory and what is not)
- benefits (the "why", ROI, measurable)
- risk (what risks, how many, how to manage) 

...or in short **BCQRST**. These variables need to be continuously monitored.

### PRINCE2 themes ###
Themes are knowledge areas of the project. They are a core activity and need to be defined whenever a project is started. These are the themes and their mapping to the principles:

- **Business Case** (business justification, reason for project)
- **progress** (manage by stages/exception, business justification, highlight and stage reports for project board, compare actual achievements to the planned ones, give forecast, control deviations)
- **organization** (roles/responsibilities, who represents sponsor, users, suppliers)
- **plans** (focus on products, includes product descriptions and project plan, needs project steps, cost and quality)
- **quality** (products need to match users expectations, quality level, continuous check)
- **risk** (evaluate and manage risks, distinction between threats and opportunities)
- **change** (issues and their impact, how to assess, act on and manage issues, also covers Configuration Management)
- **lessons learned** (learn from experience)
- **tailoring**

Organization also provides information on Project management team and its structure and accountability. This team...

- represents business, users and suppliers
- has defined responsibilities for directing, managing and delivering the project
- have a strategy to manage communication between stakeholders

PRINCE2 plan is a document describing how, when and by whom a target can be achieved. See targets above. Project plan gets updated in every stage and is compared to the baselined Project plan. There are different plans:

- project plan (high level, mainly for Project Board)
- stage plan (day-to-day-work of the PM)
- team plan (for team manager)

### common project failures ###
- insufficient product definitions (lead to wrong product)
- lack of communication
- poor estimation of time and cost

### PRINCE2 benefits###
- established for long tine in the industry
- applicable to any project
- gives a structure for roles and responsibilities
- always focused on the product
- viability of project is constantly checked

## Themes in detail ##

### Business Case ###
- one of the first things of a PM: ask for the Business <case (although many projects don't have one)
- PRINCE2 is based on customer/supplier environment: customer specifies the result and pays, supplier provides resources and delivers the results
- customer/supplier can be inside the same company
- Business Case theme provides structure to judge whether Business Case is desirable, viable, achievable and worth the continued investment
- continuously maintained throughout the project (because changes in requirements can also lead to changes in the Business Case, e.g. if additional staff is needed)
- needs to be verified by Project Board before project starts
- Executive is resposible for the Business Case and for securing funding

So what do you get?

- output: what product will be delivered (users will use them / specialist products)
- outcome: what can users do better with that product (result of change)
- benefits: measurable improvements by using this product (advantages, usually by at least one of the stakeholders)

#### Benefits review plan####
- identifiy benefits and how they can be measured, must include a timeline (if you can't measure it, don't claim it)
- senior user (represents all users) is responsible for specifying and realizing the benefits (continued commitment to the project)

#### Content of the Business Case ####
- reasons for project, estimated costs, risks (summarized) and expected benefits and dis-benefits
- also includes timescales (project start/end, when will benefits be realized) and an investment appraisal (ROI calculation, costs vs. benefits)
- three business options: do nothing, do the minimum, do something

### Organization ###
- don't rush into implementation right away, otherwise you might find yourself chasing ghosts
- define and establish the project's structure of accountability and responsibilities (or: the "who")
- responsibilities are assigned to roles (see core principles)
- one person can have multiple roles
- each project needs direction, management, control and communication
- project stakeholders need to be informed, decision makers need to be on the board

#### Main interests / stakeholders ####
- business, user and supplier
- usually the executive represents the **business** role
- **users** are in the project board to make sure that the correct product is developed in good quality (senior user, connects PMT and users), supply benefits information
- **supplier** provides resources and skills, represented by senior supplier
- business assurance vs. user assurance = value for money vs. product works as expected
- defined responsibilities for directing, managing and delivering

#### four levels of project organization ####
1. Corporate or programme management (comissioning the project)
2. Direction level: Project Board (make decisions, approve resources, plans, deviations)
3. Management level: Project Manager (run the project according to the goals)
4. Delivery level: Team Manager (create products with a certain quality within timescale and costs)

Project Management Team includes the three lower levels.

#### Project Board ####
- consist of executive, senior user and senior supplier (decision makers)
- only one executive, but potentially multiple senior users/suppliers
- executive owns Business Case and has the final word on decisions
- PB is accountable for success/failure of the project and provides a unified direction to project and PM
- PB provides resources and funds, supports the PM, ensures effective communication
- PB may delegate responsibility to a Change Authority (person/group)

#### Project Manager / Team Manager ####

- PM manages on day-to-day-basis and usually comes from the customer (preferred by PRINCE2)
- needs to be proactive, may take roles Project Support, Team Manager and Change Authority
- stakeholder management: identify and communicate effectively with people that have interest in project outcome
- team manager is optional, may be needed for geographical reasons or when the project is big or complex/highly specialized


#### Communication Management Strategy ####
- document describing how communication will be done (what, to whom, how often)
- essentially the **rules of engagement** of communication
- responsibility of the PM during Initiation Stage
- contains information on communication methods, tools/techniques, reporting, timing, roles & responsibilities, stakeholders, needed information


### Quality ###

- define and implement a system that will create and verify that products are fit for use
- product needs to meet the expectations and can be used as intended
- product descriptions must include quality criteria (e.g. dishwasher-proof, keeps color for 20 years) to get some details
- quality: total amount of features/characteristics of a product
- provides a method to specify quality, carry out quality control, explain how to get quality approved and facilitates quality management during the project

#### Approach ####
- Quality Planning: identifying the products to control, writing a product description for them (quality criteria, assessment, methods, acceptance procedures, responsibilities for people)
- Quality control: implement and track quality methods
- Quality assurance: focus on quality in the **organization**, independent review, complies to company standards, quality processes are in place
- project assurance: inside the PMT, duty of the Project Board, related to the project

#### Quality planning #####
- agree on acceptance criteria with Project Board
- communicate agreements to stakeholders
- establish how quality can be controlled (baseline and tolerances)

##### Customer quality expectations #####
- get the quality expectations (e.g. from the client)
- typical questions: budget for critical issues, what needs to be ready on launch, what's the cost for the company if product cannot be used
- priorizing via **M**o**SC**o**W**

##### Acceptance critiera #####
- customer and supplier agree on acceptance criteria that the product should have when complete
- can be a simple list with the criteria itself, its priorization (MoSCoW) and the current status (Yes/No)
- responsibilities: PM collects inspection/survey and other documents, executive confirms project and manufacturing, Senior User is responsible for all other acceptance criteria

##### Quality Management Strategy document #####
- defines quality requirements and control methods for all products in a project
- defines how quality standards are applied ("how quality will be done")
- typical topics: what system/standard, tools and techniques, who is responsible for documenting and approving/confirming, timing of activities

##### Project Product descriptions #####
- created for all products as part of the planning activities (before Project Plan is completed)
- needs to contain quality criteria, acceptance methods and acceptance responsibilities
- typical content: identififier, title (of the product), purpose, composition (parts), quality criteria, q. tolerance, q. method, q. skills (e.g. knowledge for testing), q. responsibilities
- project product description (one document) is the description of the main product and more like an overview and is created in the Start Up phase (usually 2-4 pages with a lot of quality-related information)

##### Quality register #####
- diary of quality events during the project
- may be a spreadsheet with these columns: product id, name, producer, reviewer, approver, target/actual review date, target/actual approve date, result
- most of the data can be retrieved from the plans documents

#### Quality review (meeting)####
- four roles: chair (host), presenter (represents product producers), reviewer (reviews, asks, confirms), administrator (admin support for chair) or CRAP
- objectives: assess products against criteria, involve stakeholders, provide confirmation, sign off the product (create baseline, no more changes)
- output: decision to quality-approve products or not (complete, conditionally complete or incomplete)

### Plans ###
- failing to plan is planning to fail
- plan always needs to show that targets are achievable
- project plan answers Why, What, Who, When and How much
- plan theme provides a framework to design, develop and maintain project plans

#### Projects Plan levels ####
- Project Plan: direction level (so high-level), used by Project Board, shows major products, resources, activities, their cost and when they will be delivered, approved by executive, will be baselined for later reference
- Stage Plan: management level, created for each stage with more detail, used by PM day-to-day
- Team Plans: delivery level (team manager), plan the work in Work Packages
- there may be Exception plans (when out of tolerances, get porject bac on track, replaces project/stage plan, PM must inform PB) 
- there will be a benefits review plan (part of business case)
- typical contents of plan: prerequisites, assumptions, incorporated lessons, budget, monitoring and control information, tolerances (time, cost, scope and maybe risk, quality, benefits), product descriptions (including quality information)

#### Product-based planning ####
four steps:

1. write Project Product Description (describe main product, SU phase)
2. create product breakdown structure (list all products)
3. write product descriptions (for required products)
4. create product flow diagram (product flows/interdependencies, product sequence, a bit like an IKEA assembly diagram)

background

- senior user/senior supplier provide information on project product description, PM coordinates work (consult with senior user, executive, specialists)
- product breakdown structure provides a hierarchical overview (may be a mind map)
- product checklist lists all major products and delivery dates
- iterative process, clarifies scope
- shows interdependencies and avoids wrong expectations
- plans help to focus on products and manage by stages

#### Creation of plans ####
- Initiation Stage Plan for the first stage is created by PM
- Product-based plans are created by PM and/or TM, used in SU, IP and SB processes
- Stage Plan is created by PM during SB process
- project plan needs to be approved by PB, is also updated in SB process and at the end of project
- team plans are optional, created by TM
- Executive approves project plan
